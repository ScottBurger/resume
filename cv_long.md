## Employment History

### Senior Data Scientist, Engineering Analytics - Qualtrics (Oct 2019 - Oct 2024)
Developed the centralized reporting dashboard and infrastructure for C-Suite visibility into company-level metrics such as: Ease of Use, Pace of Interactions, Time to Value, Number of Interactions, Monthly Active Users, Daily Active Users, Monthly Active Brands, Jira Pulse SLAs, Data Center Availability, Service Level Objectives, Security Patching, and 20 other main metrics used for criticial success measurement across Product, Experience, and Engineering. Accomplished with Python, Prefect, and Tableau.

Leading critical operational metrics of 50+ different KPIs visible to Engineering leadership and C-Suite. 40% of all engineers in the company have interacted with Eng Analtyics data products and 35% of the entire company overall. For our most recent quarterly review, a majority of users were saved a great deal of time and had a great deal of decision making process influenced by our Tableau dashboards, Redshift tables, and Airflow DAGs.

Managed mission-critical operation of operational review metrics used in realtion to Jira data. Major investigations and realtime reporting on customer pulses, deep dives on product quality feedback, and analyses of backlog management across all Engineering teams.

Investigated OKR adoption practices and made a company-wide change for OKRs to be more tightly linked via manager-direct objective-result pair linking.

Identified 140 brands to be targeted by the Qualtrics Preview Program with a net revenue lift of $14M+.

Led an investigation into pre- and post-pandemic Engineering efficiency metrics and found that Qualtrics transitioned with no statistically significant impact on developer productivity. Led initiatives on data governance to establish the adoption of Alation and data documenation best practice updates.

Led an initiative to bring analytics team across the company together for informal tech talks, averaging two per month.

---

Mentored 16 people through the Q-Mentor program, ranging from junior and intern-level data scientists, to senior and staff level technical program managers. I recieved highly favorable reviews from mentees and would often extend the mentorship program beyond its originally scoped timeframe in order to continue the program, per mentee requests.

Upgraded 137 internal company reports and dashboards to a new framework leveraging enhanced data governance principles via internal wiki management and internal developer tooling.

Managed and operated a brand admin contact data workflow that was critical for corporate communication between engineering teams and externally-facing communications departments. This system allowed non-techncial users to reach out directly to brand admininstrators to keep them updated on important features and changes. This had visibility up to the Chief People Officer.

Led several initiatives for upgrading and evaluating alternatives for internal business intelligence reporting software including Tableau, AWS Quicksight, Google Looker, and Apache Superset. Ultimately landed on continuing to use Tableau as our reporting platform and drove requirments to have additional reporting moved off of Redash and into the Tableau ecosystem.

Reported a deep dive analysis of employee engagement data showing major factors and trends regarding return-to-office logistics. Most employees onboarded since full remote work missed having more social team gatherings, and a major inhibitor to return-to-office being commute timing.

Developed and maintained a scorecard for engineering managers that would track OKR attainment, organization size, DevOps related metrics for things like commit frequency, customer pulse data for any given manager's organization, and other kinds of employee engagement data.

Developed and maintained numerous dashboards and data sources for the Launch Readiness program that enabled the team to understand how effective and efficient the program is currently, and how it has evolved over time. This initiative drove major changes the the launch process and simplified processes considerably for many engineering teams.

Developed and owned an engineering-wide metric for the number of features adopted per team per quarter. Established data baselines and set target goals for engineering teams to meet based on historical data trends.

Automated a major headcount data workflow for engineering managers, saving a great deal of time for L6s and above involved in the hiring process.

Developed and owned an engineering-wide processes scorecard that documented 76 KPIs across organization metrics, outcome metrics, and process metrics.

Developed a process to understand data product impact and found that my dashboards and reports had saved staff in engineering upwards of 500 hours of time per quarter and about 260 hours of non-engineer time.

Upgraded and optimized many engineering data sources from an OLTP instance of AWS Aurora to OLAP Redshift. Many of which saving upwards of 40 hours of maintenance time per quarter, simplifying ETLs to be easier to debug and understand, and allowing more expansive feature sets to be built on top of them in the future. 

Led an analysis of how renewal rates tie to a brandâ€™s Preview Program membership to indicate big advances in various client tiers, with a net positive impact. I showed upwards of 14% renewal increase in high tier accounts and upwards of 113% in mid-level tier accounts.

Developed and owned a dynamic ownership mapping system of internal operations data to identify "who owns what" based on organizational hierarchies. Engineering managers were able to see in databases which programs were owned by who at what time and how organizational charts evolved over time.

Developed and owned a more accessible frontend API interface to the Qualtrics YellowPages project. This enabled engineering program managers to export data from internal APIs in a more useful and straightforward way as opposed to writing individual API queries to retrieve data on program ownership and details.

Performed an analysis on several Qualtrics products and tied customer satisfaction to them to understand which ones were driving positive PSAT and which ones were driving negative PSAT. This was used by program managers to further understand customer frustrations and optimize user journey flows for better product experiences.

Owned and maintained documentation on analytical best practices at Qualtrics, ranging from query optimization guides on AWS systems, managing python and R connections to data platforms, best practices on Bi and reporting structure, data analytics interview question design, and resources for growing data and analytics skillsets.

Performed behavior and techcnical interview screens for 20 applicates for various roles at Qualtrics, ranging from junior to senior level data positions.

Owned and operated over 100 enginering data sources and dashboards related to top-level KPIs with domains ranging from Jira customer pulse data, Launch Readiness Review data, engineering QA and testing data, internal operations data related to things like engineering efficiency and organizational data, DevOps metrics, and engineering infrastructure metrics like data center reliability and availability.

Productionalized a predictive model for Jira pulse volume prediction. This enabled engineering QE teams and frontline ticket support to better understand when to expect high volumes of support requests from customers and at what severity level.

Productionalized a Jira pulse volume anomaly detection model for engineering teams. This helped to set real-time alerts for when customer ticket creation volumes spiked for specific teams, but also showed when teams were experiencing lower than normal ticket volumes, so both sides of the RCA success story could be told.

Developed and operated a plan across numerous teams in engineering to onboard and adopt AWS Redshift as the internal standard for company-wide data warehousing. Drove requirements for better analytics framework best practices, including formalizing metrics and report specific schemas in the new data warehouse. This helped to save massive amounts of time and effort from originally developing analytics queries on the OLTP framework of AWS Aurora, which at the time did not support even CTE functionality.

Worked with HR and recruiting to develop internal headcount reporting dashboards used for budget and planning purposes across engineering and other orgs at the company. Visibily up to C-Suite to help drive decisions on organizational management.

Productionalized a predicitive hiring model for engineering to assess growth of the organization at various seniority levels and track potential growth for various engineering teams.

Developed and maintained data sources and dashboards to track engineering-wide OKR attainment at all management levels. Visibility up to CTO helped enable standardization of org-wide best practices and maintain alignment with working procedures to show a clear chain of how individual objectives ladder up to org-wide initiatives.

Developed and owned standardized best practice documentation for usage of Presto and Data Lake. This initiative helped to evangelize use cases for each of these systems to other data users, reduce overhead for the core data engineering team, and ultimately drive data end users to the best ecosystem that suits their use cases.

Owned and operated a data governance v-team across numerous organizations including engineering, revenue operations, finance, security, data engineering, and sales operations.

Productionalized and owned a data source for tracking internal company wiki pageview statistics. This helped teams across the company understand how useful their documentation was overall, who the major consumers of their documentation were, and how they were trending over time.

Drive company best practices for internal reporting standards. Worked with internal development operations teams to move over 100 reports from a system managed by a siloed centralized team into the self-serve company-wide internal wiki. This helped drastically reduce update and KTLO time for the internal development teams, and helped enable many new useful features including data governance applications. A centralized structure helped realign company reporting in a one-stop-shop area so senior leadership could easily navigate various company KPIs.

Owned and maintained over two dozen airflow automation pipelines critical for engineering data success related to Jira data, GitLab DevOps metrics, and other sources of data.

Performed a research investigation into potential hiring bias in the engineering organization for historically underrepresented groups (HUGS) and found no statistically significant areas of concern.

Owned and maintained data sources and reporting infrastructure related to engineering data center reliability data. This helped engineers and leadership understand where issues were happening, which teams were responsible, SLAs for action, and associated metrics.

Productionalized and maintined data sources and reporting for engineering QA sytems including Testrail. This helped engineers understand where unit, integration, and end-to-end tests were happening with a high degree of granularity down to specific teams, but also being able to be aggregated up to specific engineering managers as well. 

Helped foster and develop the data engineering-led initiative "Data Champions" which nominated representatitves from across the company's organizations to serve as data experts for specific areas of focus.
