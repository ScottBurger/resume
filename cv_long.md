## Employment History

### Head of Engineering Analytics - Qualtrics (Oct 2019 - present)
Leading critical operational metrics of 50+ different KPIs visible to Engineering leadership
and C-Suite. 40% of all engineers in the company have interacted with Eng Analtyics data
products and 35% of the entire company overall. For our most recent quarterly review, a majority
of users were saved a great deal of time and had a great deal of decision making process influenced
by our Tableau dashboards, Redshift tables, and Airflow DAGs.

Managed mission-critical operation of operational review metrics used in realtion to Jira data.
Major investigations and realtime reporting on customer pulses, deep dives on product quality
feedback, and analyses of backlog management across all Engineering teams.

Investigated OKR adoption practices and made a company-wide change for OKRs to be more
tightly linked via manager-direct objective-result pair linking.

Identified 140 brands to be targeted by the Qualtrics Preview Program with a net revenue
lift of $14M+.

Led an investigation into pre- and post-pandemic Engineering efficiency metrics and found
that Qualtrics transitioned with no statistically significant impact on developer productivity.
Led initiatives on data governance to establish the adoption of Alation and data documenation
best practice updates.

Led an initiative to bring analytics team across the company together for informal tech talks.

---

Mentored 16 people through the Q-Mentor program, ranging from junior and intern-level data scientists, to senior and staff level technical program managers. I recieved highly favorable reviews from mentees and would often extend the mentorship program beyond its originally scoped timeframe in order to continue the program, per mentee requests.

Upgraded 137 internal company reports and dashboards to a new framework leveraging enhanced data governance principles via internal wiki management and internal developer tooling.

Managed and operated a brand admin contact data workflow that was critical for corporate communication between engineering teams and externally-facing communications departments. This system allowed non-techncial users to reach out directly to brand admininstrators to keep them updated on important features and changes. This had visibility up to the Chief People Officer.

Led several initiatives for upgrading and evaluating alternatives for internal business intelligence reporting software including Tableau, AWS Quicksight, Google Looker, and Apache Superset. Ultimately landed on continuing to use Tableau as our reporting platform and drove requirments to have additional reporting moved off of Redash and into the Tableau ecosystem.

Reported a deep dive analysis of employee engagement data showing major factors and trends regarding return-to-office logistics. Most employees onboarded since full remote work missed having more social team gatherings, and a major inhibitor to return-to-office being commute timing.

Developed and maintained a scorecard for engineering managers that would track OKR attainment, organization size, DevOps related metrics for things like commit frequency, customer pulse data for any given manager's organization, and other kinds of employee engagement data.

Developed and maintained numerous dashboards and data sources for the Launch Readiness program that enabled the team to understand how effective and efficient the program is currently, and how it has evolved over time. This initiative drove major changes the the launch process and simplified processes considerably for many engineering teams.

Developed and owned an engineering-wide metric for the number of features adopted per team per quarter. Established data baselines and set target goals for engineering teams to meet based on historical data trends.

Automated a major headcount data workflow for engineering managers, saving a great deal of time for L6s and above involved in the hiring process.

Developed and owned an engineering-wide processes scorecard that documented 76 KPIs across organization metrics, outcome metrics, and process metrics.

Developed a process to understand data product impact and found that my dashboards and reports had saved staff in engineering upwards of 500 hours of time per quarter and about 260 hours of non-engineer time.

Upgraded and optimized many engineering data sources from an OLTP instance of AWS Aurora to OLAP Redshift. Many of which saving upwards of 40 hours of maintenance time per quarter, simplifying ETLs to be easier to debug and understand, and allowing more expansive feature sets to be built on top of them in the future. 

Led an analysis of how renewal rates tie to a brand’s Preview Program membership to indicate big advances in various client tiers, with a net positive impact. I showed upwards of 14% renewal increase in high tier accounts and upwards of 113% in mid-level tier accounts.

Developed and owned a dynamic ownership mapping system of internal operations data to identify "who owns what" based on organizational hierarchies. Engineering managers were able to see in databases which programs were owned by who at what time and how organizational charts evolved over time.

Developed and owned a more accessible frontend API interface to the Qualtrics YellowPages project. This enabled engineering program managers to export data from internal APIs in a more useful and straightforward way as opposed to writing individual API queries to retrieve data on program ownership and details.

Performed an analysis on several Qualtrics products and tied customer satisfaction to them to understand which ones were driving positive PSAT and which ones were driving negative PSAT. This was used by program managers to further understand customer frustrations and optimize user journey flows for better product experiences.

Owned and maintained documentation on analytical best practices at Qualtrics, ranging from query optimization guides on AWS systems, managing python and R connections to data platforms, best practices on Bi and reporting structure, data analytics interview question design, and resources for growing data and analytics skillsets.

Performed behavior and techcnical interview screens for 20 applicates for various roles at Qualtrics, ranging from junior to senior level data positions.

Owned and operated over 100 enginering data sources and dashboards related to top-level KPIs with domains ranging from Jira customer pulse data, Launch Readiness Review data, engineering QA and testing data, internal operations data related to things like engineering efficiency and organizational data, DevOps metrics, and engineering infrastructure metrics like data center reliability and availability.

Developed a predictive model for pulse volume prediction. 


### Senior Marking Analyst - Tableau Software (Feb 2018 - Oct 2019)
Led a team of data scientists and data engineers to build a multi-touch attribution model
in Google Bigquery and R. Owned and maintained data sources critical to the Marketing organization’s daily operation. My team’s projects had visibility to executives including user journey path analysis, realtime dashboarding for major product launches, and predictive customer lifetime value models. Handled data science interviewing, onboarding, and intern transitions to full time employment.


### Data Scientist - Microsoft (May 2014 - Jan 2018)

Worked across many teams including Visual Studio Team Services, Azure, Engineering Customer Interactions, Data & Decision Sciences.
Developed data engineering pipelines in Kusto, Dax, and SSIS to provide high-visibility insights in PowerBI to stakeholders in numerous product organizations including Legal, Xbox, and Support.

__[The Data Science of Board Games](https://svburger.com/2017/09/03/info-for-attendees-of-my-pax-talk/)__ - Penny Arcade Expo, Seattle 2017. Board games have seen an unprecedented boom in their popularity recently. In this talk ,I walked through data on over 250,000 board games from the beginning of civilization to modern times to chart the trends, looking at insights about ratings, balance, and guilty pleasures hidden in the data to shed light on this booming sector of gaming.

__User-Based Reviews and the PC Gaming Ecosytem: What It Takes to Survive in the Videogame World of 2015__ - The Data Science Conference, Chicago 2015. At this conference I detailed a method for quantifying emotions and polarity of text-based, user-submitted reviews through the PC gaming digital distribution service, Steam. In my work, I showed that the current algorithms in use are not well suited for aggregating user emotion, as the algorithm is highly dictionary-dependant for word categorization. However, word polarity aggregation appeared to be a worthwhile metric to investigate.
