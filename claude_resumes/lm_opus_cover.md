Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the AI Technical Leader position within the Lockheed Martin Artificial Intelligence Center (LAIC) team. With over a decade of experience in data science, machine learning, and analytics, I am confident that my skills and expertise align well with the requirements of this role and the mission of Lockheed Martin.

Throughout my career, I have successfully led cross-functional teams in developing and deploying AI-driven solutions that tackle complex business problems. At Qualtrics, I developed a centralized reporting dashboard that provided C-Suite visibility into critical company-level metrics, leveraging Python, Prefect, and Tableau. I also productionalized predictive models for Jira pulse volume prediction and anomaly detection, demonstrating my ability to deliver actionable insights and augment human capabilities in various work settings.

My experience at Microsoft further showcases my proficiency in applying machine learning techniques to real-world challenges. I worked across multiple teams, including Visual Studio Team Services, Azure, and Engineering Customer Interactions, where I developed data engineering pipelines and built models to detect at-risk product keys, global piracy patterns, and predict code signing time for large builds.

I am particularly drawn to Lockheed Martin's dedication to its mission and the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse team of AI/Machine Learning specialists, developers, data engineers, and product managers. My strong problem-solving skills, business acumen, and excellent communication abilities position me well to identify valuable ways of incorporating machine learning into business workflows and processes.

Moreover, I am committed to staying updated on new technologies in the rapidly evolving field of AI. I have hands-on experience with natural language processing, deep learning, and various cloud platforms, which I believe will be valuable in contributing to the LAIC team's innovative projects.

I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to Lockheed Martin's mission and the success of the LAIC team. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Samuel Bespoke
